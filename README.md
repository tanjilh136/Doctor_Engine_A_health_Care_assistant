Most of the people (87%) are affected by Ischemic stroke. To distinguish this hemorrhage, we got to do a lab test at therapeutic. But that's exceptionally costly for our country Individuals. So, we choose to do something for them. After huge research, we developed a project which can detect this type of hemorrhage using deep learning neural network based algorithm. To do that we collected raw data (CT Scan Copy) from a number of hospital, we preprocessed it with a help of radiologist and finally trained our model to nail our goal, which is detecting hemorrhage stroke. Right now, we have achieved 90 up percentage accuracy in total.
